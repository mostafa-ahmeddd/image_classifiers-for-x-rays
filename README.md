# CNN and Transfer Learning Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, Transfer Learning models, and Fine-tuning techniques using a single Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide on how to build, train, and evaluate these models for image classification tasks.

## Contents

- `model_notebook.ipynb`: Notebook containing all code for creating and training a CNN model, implementing transfer learning using a pre-trained model, and fine-tuning the model for better performance on a specific task.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-transfer-learning.git
cd cnn-transfer-learning
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Select and run `model_notebook.ipynb`.
